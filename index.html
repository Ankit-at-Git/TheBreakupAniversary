        <h1>Happy 6 months breakup anniversary Bhavyaa.</h1>
        <div class="message">
            <div class="dear">Dear Bhavyaa,</div>
            <div class="feel">
                <p>Relax!chill! This is not a proposal message or a message to illustrate myself a so called “bechara”
                    because I never meant to bother you. yeah!! It’s been 6 months since we broke up, but I'm not so
                    happy with your decision as I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be your boyfriend anyway leave
                    it as I don't want to irritate you with these things so if you are happy then i am also happy but!
                    but! Don’t be too happy because we still have long way to go. I know it was nothing less than a
                    nightmare for you but for me, it was the best time of my life.(Attention :- This is not because I was
                    talking to a girl or girlfriend, in fact in the tuition there were 8 girls, and I was the only boy So
                    it's not like I was getting attention from a girl for the first time).Those late night talking to
                    you on the terrace in the gusts of wind. Those video calls, waiting for your calls was a wonderful
                    experience for me. A funny case reminded me of the incident that happened when we were in
                    relationship like our fight on petty things like squabbling over sweetass- myass issue,I used to ask
                    you “paaka” and you immediately replied “nahi” and once I asked you will you marry me?? and you
                    instantly replied “No” and I used to tell you “ki rehne de” and you sarcastically replied “tu rehne
                    de” and the list continues, but I think I am irritating you by remembering old incidents but that's I
                    can’t control myself from telling the last one…. So if you remembered I once said that “ki mai
                    physically satisfied ho jaunga tab bta dunga” and you said “ki acha! mai satisfied houn ya na houn
                    lekin tu pehle satisfied ho jayio” I know it was so stupid but also funny and many more these
                    laughable memories but relax I am going to tell everything here…because I know you are not
                    interested. <br><br>
                    If I had one superpower,it would definitely be the ability to turn back time and cherish those
                    precious moments that made such beautiful memories like desperately and quickly completing my
                    running so that I can talk to you. That feeling yaar!! Literally it was the best phase of my entire
                    life and You were like a fortune that happened to me. I really really really admire and respect you.
                    Thanks to you Bhavyaa for such beautiful memories. Cheers to our craziness!! I promise to be with
                    you and support you no matter what. And last one that I will not say I love you because that is
                    cheap,nor I will say that I can do anything for you like I will give my life, or I can break “chand
                    sitare” for you because all these things are cheap and practically impossible and useless all I can
                    say is “After my parents and real siblings, I have so much trust only on you, and I am comfortable
                    only with you”,more than relatives. And i than you are a brilliant student, so I think you can
                    understand what you mean to me. This message will not adequately explain my feelings for you.
